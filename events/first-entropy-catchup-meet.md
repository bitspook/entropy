Primary purpose of this meetup is to:

1. Share projects want to work on, for which you'd like to have contributors.
2. Find if anyone is starting/working-on any projects you'd like to contribute
   to.

There is no limit on what kind of projects these might be, but it would be a lot
cooler if they have a social aspect to them, i.e projects with a goal of adding
some direct positive value to society.

If you belong to #1 above, you will be given time to pitch your idea to everyone
joined. When you are pitching your idea, please also mention if you are willing
to mentor young'uns willing to contribute (or old'uns, anyone really. Ageism not
intended).

If you belong to #2 above, you can approach the project owner right there, or
after the meetup. If you think you will need some guidance before you can
contribute (e.g if you are a student, or new to building software, or new to a
particular technology etc), we'll try to arrange someone to mentor you. This can
be the same person who is owning a particular project, or someone else from the
community who can play the role of a mentor for you.

For pitching your idea, any form of slides or something isn't required. But
please structure your thoughts such that they can be conveyed in a 10-15
minutes.
