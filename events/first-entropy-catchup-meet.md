Primary purpose of this meetup is to brainstorm what we as individuals, and as a
group can do to bootstrap a healthy tech culture in Chandigarh.

Tricity area, despite having a vibrant tech industry don't have much of a tech
culture. In this meetup we'll discuss if and to what extent this statement is
true, what it mean to have a tech culture, what should be the concrete goals we
should set to have one, and how we can achieve those goals.
