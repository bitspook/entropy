Primary purpose of this meetup is to brainstorm what we as individuals, and as a
group can do to bootstrap a healthy tech culture in Chandigarh.

Tricity area, despite having a vibrant tech industry don't have much of a tech
culture. In this meetup we'll discuss if and to what extent this statement is
true, what it mean to have a tech culture, what should be the concrete goals we
should set to have one, and how we can achieve those goals.

-   Chandigarh has a culture problem which needs solved
-   We need to spread awareness about tech industry, what is available out in the
    world so young professionals don't get trapped in small wells created by small
    people and end up getting exploited and burnt out
-   We need to encourage people to explore diverse technologies
-   We need more people in the Entropy group. There are always going to be a
    majority of lurkers, so we need more people to increase the probability of
    having a few thinkers and movers

Immediate action items:

-   Contact tech-club-leaders in local colleges regarding organizing online
    career counseling meetups with interested students.

    Goal is to find like minded people who can bring some activity in the group,
    and use the group to educate themselves and launch their careers with a better
    understanding of the industry

-   Start "Breaking Interviews" initiative

    An initiative to figure out how to break very flawed interview process based
    on competitive programming. We'll start with having a process of doing some
    competitive programming in Entropy itself (have a leaderboard etc) to get to
    know the enemy, and then proceed to see how to do damage to the practice
    itself.

Future action items:

-   Contact famous people to hold talks in Entropy
