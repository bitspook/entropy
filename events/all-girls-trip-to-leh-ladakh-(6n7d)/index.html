TGE organiser will will be at hotel to welcome you :)<br>Today’s day is extremely important for acclimatisation, so try to stay indoors as much as possible and try not to exert yourself.

Located at an altitude of 9846 ft , it is inhabited by the Balti people of Tibetian Decent. The Beautiful village of Turtuk is located at the edge of Shayok valley which is part of Nubra valley. Untill 1971 Turtuk was part of Baltistan which was under control of Pakistan. The interesting story that goes around Turtuk by elders is about how one day when they went to bed in night they were in Pakistan and when they woke up they were part of India. To enter Turtuk you have to cross a wooden bridge on top of a river , surrounded with apricot trees, this village is certainly one of most beautiful and colorful villages in our route.<br>We plan to return back to our homestay in Hunder by evening.<br><br>Day 5<br>Hunder to Pangong Tso<br>Today we start early for the most awaited part of the trip, the beautiful Pangong lake.

Pangong Lake is situated at a height of 14,270 ft above sea level and is said to be one of the highest saline water lake in the world. Lying almost on the Indo-Chinese border, a part of it falls in India, while the other is in China. The beauty of the lake is such that it has been a cinematic backdrop for the popular movie, 3 Idiots. In fact, there is a 3 Idiots Point in the area, where the famous yellow scooter from the movie's climax is stationed. The lake is about 5 km wide at its broadest point and about 134 km in length.
