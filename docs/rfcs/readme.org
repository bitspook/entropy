This directory contains problems/initiatives/ideas proposed by members of
Entropy, for which we are still figuring out a plan of action.

Here's list of reasons for which the problem/initiative/idea is kept under this
directory instead of [[../initiatives][initiatives]]:

1. We are unsure if we want to solve this problem

   A problem might be too personal to the member who added it, and other members
   are simply not interested in solving it at this point.

2. Problem or problem statement is too vague to be actionable

3. There is no clear course of action for a solution

   A course of action also needs an attainable goal. It is considered best to
   have something that can be represented with concrete numbers. We can however
   settle for a clear indicator of change for good.
