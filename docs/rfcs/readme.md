Problems/ideas proposed by members of Entropy, for which we are still figuring
out a plan of action.

Here's list of reasons for which the problem/idea is kept under this directory
instead of initiatives:

1. No one wants to work on it

   A member has added a problem they'd like solved, but no-one, including the OP
   want to work on it right now. There need to be at least one person willing to
   own the problem and work for its solution.

2. Problem or problem statement does not meet prerequisites for being an
   initiative

3. There is no clear course of action for a solution

   A course of action also needs an attainable goal. It is considered best to
   have something that can be represented with concrete numbers. We can however
   settle for a clear indicator of change for good.
