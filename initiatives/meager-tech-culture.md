The first problem I can identify is lack of a tech culture in the city. Entropy
will die down if there are no hackers to participate in it.

Following are the reasons I can think of, solving which might help.

## Fragmentation

Tech scene in Chandigarh is not completely devoid of activity. There are small
groups which do occasional meetups. Multiple small groups operating in isolation
could be a problem. I am not advocating clubbing all smaller groups into a
guild, quite the contrary. We should celebrate diversity and individual freedom.
If anyone want to start a tech group of their own, we should welcome it. But
this causes problem of discovery for people who want to participate. That's the
problem we should solve.

One possible solution is to setup an aggregator, which can aggregate content
from wherever the tech-group operates primarily.

*** Action items
- [X] Prepare a list of all the tech groups that associate with Chandigarh [[https://github.com/channikhabra/entropy/issues/2][#2]]
- [-] Build an aggregator which can scrap content from above list [[https://github.com/channikhabra/entropy/issues/3][#3]]
- [ ] Build a website to present these groups and their events [[https://github.com/channikhabra/entropy/issues/1][#1]] [[https://github.com/channikhabra/entropy/issues/3][#4]]
- [ ] Allow Entropy members to subscribe to particular topics, groups, or
  everything

Most straightforward goal we can set up is perhaps that we have some active
users in our own community. 10 sounds like a fair number.
