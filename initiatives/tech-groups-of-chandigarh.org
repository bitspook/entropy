Let's prepare an exhaustive list of all the tech groups which are operating in
vicinity of Chandigarh.

* Meetup.com

Meetup.com is a platform where anyone can create a meetup group and start
hosting events. There are a number of groups here, and it is likely that new
groups keep popping up. Along with creating a list of meetup.com groups, we
should also devise a way to periodically find out new groups.

** Discovering new groups

When searching for groups by city (~100M of Chandigarh), almost all groups that
come up are technical. We should set up a scraper to scrap data from these
groups. Discovering new groups can look like this:

1. Scrap the meetup [[https://www.meetup.com/find/?allMeetups=true&radius=100&userFreeform=Chandigarh%2C%20India&mcId=z1018132&mcName=Chandigarh%2C%20IN&sort=recommended&eventFilter=mysugg&location=in--chandigarh&source=GROUPS&categoryId=562][search page]]
2. For every group found from search page, create a =Draft= entry
3. Create an approval page where a user manually approve the group
   - This will need an authentication system. For starters, we can make this
     process "local only", i.e this is supposed to be run locally. This will be
     a mere convenience for creating a static page in =groups/group-name.md=
4. Recursively scan users of the groups, and the groups they follow; and add
   them to drafts as well. It is possible that we miss some ill-configured
   groups which might be relevant to hackers of Chandigarh.
