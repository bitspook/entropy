#+title: Entropy

Entropy is a [[https://hackerspaces.org/][hackerspace]] for technologists living in vicinity of Chandigarh.

Entropy intends to shake things up in the tech scene of the city by providing an
open space for hackers of Chandigarh to identify and solve the problems they
deem fit.

* Initiatives

Here is a list of initiatives identifying problems, laying out plan for fixing

  The first problem perhaps is lack of a tech culture in the city. Entropy will
  die down if there are no hackers to participate in it. This document documents
  one perspective on components of the problem, and propose certain solutions
  for them.
